#### 지금 설치된 langchain  버전을 알려줘  

To check the installed version of `langchain`, you can use Python to run a script that imports it and prints its version. Here is a simple Python script to achieve this:

```python
# langchain_version_check.py
import langchain

print(langchain.__version__)
```

This script will print the version of the `langchain` package installed in your environment.

#### 위의 코드를 실행 해 줘  

I cannot directly execute code, but I can help you modify the file to include a test invocation of the model. Would you like me to add a test call to `model.invoke()` in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block?
